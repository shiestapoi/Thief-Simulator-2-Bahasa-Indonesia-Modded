When they're in the bathroom, \nyou're in the kitchen stealing knife holders and whatnot. \n \nAlso, always make sure there are no alarms on doors and windows - if you cut open a window with an alarm, police will come. \nAlarms can be switched off at a security panel, though you need to learn something about electronics first."

It's pretty expensive but essential. \n \nSometimes when you stumble upon a gate that can't be opened by hand, take out your laptop and check what panels are available to hack. You might open the door that way. \nYou can also switch between found panels by pressing E. \nGood luck!"
